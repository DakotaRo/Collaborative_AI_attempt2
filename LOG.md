# Collaborative_AI_pt2

## August 15:
Decided on making some sort of collaborative AI

Decided to start with single agent genetic algorithm machine learning

## August 17:
Downloaded Unity

Downloaded VS Code

Started research on GA (used [brilliant.org](https://brilliant.org/courses/intro-neural-networks/introduction-65/))

Set up GitHub

## August 21: 
Did more research on brilliant.org

## August 22:
Learned more about neural networks on brilliant.org

Started the Unity 3D project due to my previous experience with 3D

Borrowed [character controller code](https://itnext.io/how-to-write-a-simple-3d-character-controller-in-unity-1a07b954a4ca) from Ing. Jan Jileƒçek

## August 24: 
There were some problems with the character controller code in Unity, so I had to debug

After debugging the code did not work as needed, so I had to look for different code

Decided on using a simplified version of the code from [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HpC--2iowE) video by Brackeys 

## August 29:
Focused research on machine learning and found [this](https://machinelearningmastery.com/machine-learning-in-python-step-by-step/) article

Downloaded Anaconda

## September 5:
Focused research on genetic algorithms and found this article with some [example code](https://towardsdatascience.com/introduction-to-genetic-algorithms-including-example-code-e396e98d8bf3)

Struggled trying to get java working

## September 7:
Finished setting up java

Borrowed the code from the article listed on September 5 

Decided to work on the Unity game before continuing research on genetic algorithms

## September 11:
Started work focused on creating the Unity game

Added the Unity folder to github

Finished the world for the game and looked into basic AI

## September 12:
Watched a bunch of tutorials about basic AI in Unity

## September 19:
Watching different tutorials because the ones I watched on the 12th use assets that I am unable to access

Found a tutorial with some [simple code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjkSFoLxesw)

Borrowed the code and simplified it to get rid of the attacking behavior

Used [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJu-zdZ9dyE) tutorial to fix my NavMesh issues

## September 21:
Worked on editing the code I used yesterday to make it as simple as possible while still functioning

Almost successfully simplified the code, but the agent is not moving, so I have to figure that out

## September 25:
Worked on fixing my README

## September 28:
Fixed the README and formatted the LOG

## October 3:
Watched various tutorials on how to fix the AI, none of them worked

## October 5:
Watched a few tutorials on NavMesh to see if that's the issue, but everything looked good

AI still isn't moving

## October 12:
Finally got the AI to move using different code

Updated README

Added multiple AI (4 per team)

Colored the AI to differentiate the teams
