# Collaborative_AI_pt2
 

<!-- 

August 15:
Decided on making some sort of collaborative AI
Decided to start with single agent genetic algorithm machine learning

August 17:
Downloaded Unity
Downloaded VS Code
Started research on GA (used brilliant.org)
Set up GitHub

August 21: 
Did more research on brilliant.org

August 22:
Learned more about neural networks on brilliant.org
Started the Unity 3D project due to my previous experience with 3D
Borrowed character controller code from Ing. Jan Jileček: https://itnext.io/how-to-write-a-simple-3d-character-controller-in-unity-1a07b954a4ca 

August 24: 
There were some problems with the character controller code in Unity, so I had to debug
After debugging the code did not work as needed, so I had to look for different code
Decided on using a simplified version of the code from this video by Brackeys: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HpC--2iowE 

August 29:
Focused research on machine learning and found this article: https://machinelearningmastery.com/machine-learning-in-python-step-by-step/ 
Downloaded Anaconda

September 5:
Focused research on genetic algorithms and found this article with some example code: https://towardsdatascience.com/introduction-to-genetic-algorithms-including-example-code-e396e98d8bf3 
Struggled trying to get java working

September 7:
Finished setting up java
Borrowed the code from the article listed on September 5 
Talked to Seward and decided to work on the Unity game before continuing research on genetic algorithms

September 11:
Started work focused on creating the Unity game
