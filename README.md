# Collaborative_AI_pt2
 
## Overview
The goal of this project is to create AI that will work with other agents to complete a task. Generative algorithms will be used to create agents that will work together to block multiple doors and keep a player agent from passing through.

## Current State
*updated weekly*


There has been some progress made on this project since its inception, such as:

* Creating a Unity world to test the AI on
* Began to implement an AI that moves at random (however, it does not currently work as intended)

There is still a lot to do on this project, but my next few objectives are the following:

* Fix the AI that has been implemented
* Add more agents with some having the goal to block the doors while others have the goal to pass through the doors
* Begin research on how to implement GA into the AI
